         <p>Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols.</p>
            
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <h3>Spam Filtering</h3>
            <p>Most email services offer some sort of spam filtering these days, and Google's is very effective. Gmail attempts to filter advertising spam, viruses, and phishing attempts, but no filter is 100% effective. </p>
            <h3>Space, Space, and More Space.</h3>
            <p>Gmail became popular by giving users ample storage space. Rather than deleting old messages, you could archive them. Today Gmail storage space is shared across Google accounts including Google Drive. As of this writing, the free storage space is 15 gigs across all accounts, but you can buy additional storage space if necessary.  </p>
