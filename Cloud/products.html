           <h3>Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis.</h3>
             <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <h3>Easy to use</h3>
            <p>AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS’s application hosting platform.</p>
            <h3>Cost-Effective</h3>
            <p>You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.</p>

         <h3>Gmail is a free, advertising-supported email service developed by Google. Users can access Gmail on the web and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through POP or IMAP protocols.</h3>
             <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <h3>Spam Filtering</h3>
            <p>Most email services offer some sort of spam filtering these days, and Google's is very effective. Gmail attempts to filter advertising spam, viruses, and phishing attempts, but no filter is 100% effective. </p>
            <h3>Space, Space, and More Space.</h3>
            <p>Gmail became popular by giving users ample storage space. Rather than deleting old messages, you could archive them. Today Gmail storage space is shared across Google accounts including Google Drive. As of this writing, the free storage space is 15 gigs across all accounts, but you can buy additional storage space if necessary.  </p>
